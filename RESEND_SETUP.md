# Resend Email Service Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Resend for sending professional activation emails in your emergency management platform.

## Why Switch to Resend?

- **Professional Branding**: Use your own domain for emails (e.g., admin@yourcompany.com)
- **Better Deliverability**: Higher email delivery rates compared to generic services
- **Advanced Features**: Email tracking, analytics, and bounce management
- **Industry Standard**: Used by modern SaaS applications for transactional emails

## Current Status

ðŸŸ¡ **Testing Mode**: Currently using Supabase Auth for emails (can only send to verified email addresses)

ðŸŽ¯ **Production Ready**: Resend integration is configured and ready to use once domain is verified

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Resend Account
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (includes 100 emails/day)
3. Verify your account via email

### 2. Domain Verification (Required for Production)
1. Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `yourcompany.com`)
4. Follow the DNS setup instructions:
   - Add the provided MX, TXT, and CNAME records to your DNS provider
   - This typically takes 24-48 hours to propagate
5. Wait for verification âœ…

### 3. Create API Key
1. Go to [Resend API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Name it (e.g., "Emergency Platform - Production")
4. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### 4. Update Platform Configuration

#### 4.1. Add API Key to Supabase Secrets
The `RESEND_API_KEY` secret is already configured in your Supabase project.
Update it with your new API key if needed.

#### 4.2. Update Email Function
Once your domain is verified, update the "from" address in:
`supabase/functions/send-resend-email/index.ts`

```typescript
// Change this line:
from: 'Platform Admin <onboarding@resend.dev>', 

// To your verified domain:
from: 'Platform Admin <admin@yourcompany.com>',
```

#### 4.3. Switch Email Provider
In `src/hooks/useEmailService.tsx`, change:

```typescript
// Change this line:
const EMAIL_PROVIDER: 'supabase' | 'resend' = 'supabase';

// To:
const EMAIL_PROVIDER: 'supabase' | 'resend' = 'resend';
```
