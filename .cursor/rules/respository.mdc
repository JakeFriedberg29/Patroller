# Repository Propagation Rules
   ## All repository items are created and maintained at the Platform level.  
   ## Repository items must be assigned to one or more organizational subtypes to be used as the Account level. 

---

#Report Rules
## Once set to published at the Platform level, Organization Admins of the assigned subtypes can review the reports available. 
## Organization Admins may toggle which published reports are displayed to their patrollers 
## Only reports explicitly enabled by an Organizational Admin are visible to Responders within that organization.   
## If a report's status at the Platform level is changed to Unpublished, it is immediately removed from all organizations and responders, however submissions of those reports will not be removed.
