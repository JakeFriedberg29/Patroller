# Repository Propagation Rules

- All repository items are created and maintained at the **Platform level**.  
- Repository items must be assigned to one or more **organizational subtypes** in order to be available at the **Account level**.  

---

# Report Rules

- Once set to **Published** at the Platform level, **Organization Admins** of the assigned subtypes can review the reports available.  
- Organization Admins may toggle which **Published reports** are displayed to their patrollers.  
- Only reports explicitly enabled by an Organization Admin are visible to **Responders** within that Organization.  
- If a report's status at the Platform level is changed to **Unpublished**:  
  - It is immediately removed from all Organizations and Responders.  
  - Submissions of those reports are **not removed**.
